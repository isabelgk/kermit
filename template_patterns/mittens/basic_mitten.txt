# Custom Basic Mitten Pattern

## Cuff
The cuff is knit in your choice of ribbing.

Using a stretchy method , cast on $cuff_sts stitches. Join in the round.

Work ribbing until cuff measures $cuff_length.

*Increase for the hand stitches.*

Knit, increasing $cuff_to_hand_st_increase stitches evenly to get $hand_sts stitches.

## Thumb Gusset

*Place markers for the thumb gusset on the next round.*

Knit until one stitch remains, place marker, k1.

$gusset_increase_instructions

Now, separate the thumb. Knit to marker, remove marker, slip the stitches of the thumb
gusset to scrap yarn, cast on one stitch over the gap (use the backward loop method and 
place the newly made stitch on the last needle of the round). You should now have
returned to $hand_sts stitches.

## Hand

Knit even until the hand (measured from top of the cuff) measures $hand_length. If you're
making these for someone tall, add 0.5" more.

You will now begin the spiral decreases.

$decrease_instructions

Cut yarn, leaving a 6" tail. Thread tail onto yarn needle and pull through final sts to secure.

## Thumb

**Setup round 1:** Return held thumb sts from scrap yarn to needles. With RS facing, rejoin yarn, and pick up and knit 3 sts in the gap over the cast-on st of the hand, knit to end of previously held thumb sts, knit the first picked-up st. This is the new start of round. Distribute sts across needles and join for working in the round.

**Setup round 2:** K1, k2tog, knit to last 2 sts, ssk.

Knit even until thumb is $thumb_length, approximately $thumb_rows rows.

Close thumb by working k2tog around until 5 sts remain. Cut yarn, pull tail through remaining stitches, and weave in end.

Block as desired.
