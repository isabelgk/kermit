# Custom Basic Mitten Pattern

## Cuff
The cuff is knit in your choice of ribbing.

Using a stretchy method , cast on $cuff_sts stitches. Join in the round.

Work ribbing until cuff measures $cuff_length.

*Increase for the hand stitches.*

Knit, increasing $cuff_to_hand_st_increase stitches evenly to get $hand_sts stitches.

## Thumb Gusset

*Place markers for the thumb gusset on the next round.*

Knit until one stitch remains, place marker, k1.

Now, separate the thumb. Knit to marker, remove marker, slip the stitches of the thumb
gusset to scrap yarn, cast on one stitch over the gap (use the backward loop method and 
place the newly made stitch on the last needle of the round). You should now have
returned to $hand_sts stitches.

## Hand

Knit even until the hand (measured from top of the cuff) measures $hand_length.
