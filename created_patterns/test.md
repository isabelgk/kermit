# Custom Top-Down Socks

## Cuff

Using a flexible method, like long-tail or twisted German, 
cast on 68 stitches. Join in the round. Work 
in k1, p1 ribbing for about 2".

## Leg

Continue even in pattern stitch for 34 rows, to reach 
12 inches.

## Heel Flap

Slip 34 stitches onto one needle to work for 
the heel. The remaining stitches will be worked later
for the instep. Work back and forth in rows as follows.

- *Heel flap row 1*: (RS) Knit 34, turn work.
- *Heel flap row 2*: (WS) Slip 1 purlwise wyib, purl to end of heel stitches, turn work.
- *Heel flap row 3*: (RS) Slip 1 knitwise wyib, knit to end of heel stitches, turn work.
- *Heel flap row 4*: (WS) Slip 1 purlwise wyif, purl to end of heel stitches, turn work.

Repeat *heel flap rows* 3 and 4 until 18 rows have been worked.

## Heel Turn

Beginning with a right-side row, short-rows are used to form the
cup shape of the heel.

- *Heel turn row 1*: (RS) Knit 23, ssk, turn work.
- *Heel turn row 2*: (WS) Slip 1 purlwise wyif, purl 12, p2tog, turn work.
- *Heel turn row 3*: (RS) Slip 1 purlwise wyib, knit 12, ssk, turn work.
- *Heel turn row 4*: (WS) Slip 1 purlwise wyif, purl 12, p2tog, turn work.

Repeat *heel turn rows* 3 and 4 until all heel stitches have been worked, 
ending having worked a wrong-side row. [12 + 2 stitches remain]

With RS facing, knit remaining heel stitches.

## Gusset decreases

### Gusset pick-up round

With RS facing and working under both legs of each slipped selvedge
stitch, pick up and knit 11 along the first side 
of the heel flap, picking up the last 2 stitches above the break 
between the heel and instep stitches.

Work across the instep stitches (maintaining stitch pattern).

With RS still facing, pick up and knit 11 along
the other side of the heel flap, picking up the first 2 stitches above
the break between the heel and instep stitches as before, then use
the same needle to knit half of the remaining heel stitches again.

The rounds now begin in the center of the heel stitches.

- *Gusset round 1*: Knit to the end of the heel stitches, knit all picked-up stitches through the back
loop to twist them, work across instep stitches in pattern as desired, knit all picked-up stitches 
through the back loop, knit to end of round.
- *Gusset round 2*: (Decrease round) Knit to 3 stitches before start of instep, k2tog, k1; work across 
instep stitches; k1, ssk, knit to end of round--2 gusset stitches decreased.
- *Gusset round 3*: Knit.

Repeat gusset rounds 2 and 3 until 68 remain.

## Foot
The foot length depends on the number of stitches initially cast on.

If you began with 50 or fewer cast-on stitches, work even (maintaining stitch pattern on instep
if desired) until piece measures 1.5" less than the desired finished sock foot length.

Otherwise, work even (maintaining stitch pattern on instep if desired) until the piece measures 2"
less than the desired finished sock foot length.

## Toe
- *Toe round 1*: (decrease round) Knit to 3 stitches before instep, k2tog, k2, ssk, knit to 3 stitches before end of instep, k2tog, k2, ssk, knit to end of round--4 sts decreased.
- *Toe round 2*: Knit even.

Repeat these 2 rounds 8 times.

Repeat toe round 1 every round (i.e., decrease every round) 7 times.

## Finishing

Cut yarn, leaving an 8" tail. Thread tail on a tapestry needle, draw through remaining stitches, pull tight to close hole, and secure to wrong side. Weave in loose ends, and block as desired.
