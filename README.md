# Kermit 

![Kermit](/resources/kermit-logo.png)

Kermit creates custom knitting patterns that fit your knitting style and the dimensions 
you want. This project started because I was tired of knitting socks that didn't fit my feet.
I read *Custom Socks* by Kate Atherley and was frustrated by the calculations I had to
do by hand, so I wrote some code to make my custom sock patterns for me. I am currently
working to extend to more than just sock patterns and to add more options.
