# Kermit 

## What is Kermit?

Traditional knitting patterns ask you to select yarn and needles to achieve
[gauge](https://blog.tincanknits.com/2013/08/17/gauge/) so your final product will be the right size.
That often means trying over and over to force your knitting style to match a pattern.

With Kermit, I wanted to be able to make basic patterns for any project. Instead of winging a project, 
making multiple gauge swatches, or doing tedious calculations, I wanted there to be a better way.
