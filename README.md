# Kermit 

![Kermit](/kermit/resources/kermit-logo.png)

Kermit creates custom knitting patterns that fit your knitting style and the dimensions 
you want. This project started because I was tired of knitting socks that didn't fit my feet.
I wanted to do the same for all sorts of knitting projects and make custom pattern generators
for many types of knit objects.
